## Soft Segmentation of Viral Labeled Neurons

The script designed to segment spectral (pseudo-color) viral labeled dendritic trees. It avoids hard borders and creates soft segments for each distinct pseudo-color. The package contains automatic palette calculation and post-processing (in Matlab) scripts to obtain denoised binary masks from soft segments. We developed an image flattering algorithm based on weighted L1-norm total variation to increase diffusion of viral vectors, and implemented it using Prox-TV library. We also employed BaSIC ImageJ background subtraction plugin (freely available online, also included here), if the image is corrupted by heavy background noise. As an example, recovery of green and orange neurons can be seen below:

### Install dependencies

Anaconda environments are recommended. After installing it, create an environment with Python 2.7
    
    $ conda create -n softsegment python=2.7

Then install the following dependencies: Scipy, scikit-image, cvxopt, cython, cffi, pathlib and enum34 by:

    $ conda install -c anaconda -n softsegment <package_name>
    
Make sure to activate the environment, then install Prox-TV library by:

    $ source activate softsegment
    $ pip install prox-tv
 
If you get an error while installing prox-tv due to lapack.h, try following: 

    $ sudo apt-get install liblapacke-dev


### How to run

When you open terminal, first activate your conda environment by:

    $ source activate softsegment

Then simply run following, we already have a sample image at input/ and softsegments with corresponding pseudo-color tags should appear at output/. A larger image stack with 81 planes can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HIH9FpfqfV57qX9VustR6SrIzbRMEFGh?usp=sharing):

    $ python softsegment.py

### Protocol
    - Background subtraction by BaSIC: Using ImageJ split color channels of the stack, and apply BaSIC to each channel independently by setting drift of baseline to "replace with zero". Then combine color channels and save as a tiff file
    - Modify input file name and output directory if necessary from params.json
    - Set the number of expected fluorescent labels (e.g.,6). You can choose more pseudo-colors, computed segments will be just empty if those colors do not exist
    - Simply run "python softsegment.py", it will iteratively append each plane to previously saved segments (you can check during computation)
    - Modify parameters if necessary (default parameter values are chosen heuristically after experimentation)
    - Post-processing: Choose a soft segment and update file name in the postprocess.m, update parameters if necessary (enable median filter or change number of largest connected componenets)
    - Run the script using a Matlab version with image processing toolbox (only simple mathematical morphology operations used, but R2016b or above necessary for 3d median filtering)
  

### Parameters
Note that **params.json** has all parameters. No need to modify the code if you are lazy, directly change from the file.


| Parameters |  Notes |
| ------ | ------ |
| stack_path | directory containing input stack |
| output_path | directory to save results |
| automatic_color_vertices | set 1 to compute pseudo-color palette, 0 to manually indicate |
| number_soft_segments | number of output segments (has to be same as the number of vertices, do not count black background): e.g., 6 |
| manual_vertices | if automatic computation set 0, indicate pseudo-color vertices of the hull. e.g., (ensure the first one is background) [[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]|
| drop_color | ignore one of the vertices when computing soft segments (useful if two segments are highly overlapping, just drop one) e.g., 2 or put -1 not to drop any |
| FAST | disable weighting term in the optimization function (much faster, but little suboptimal): 1 or 0 |
| SAVE_COLOR | also saves colored versions of soft segments: 1 or 0 |
| start_plane| compute segments from substack starting from e.g., 25 or set -1 to disable|
| end_plane | compute segments from substack until: e.g., 125 or set -1 to disable|

The following parameters are used to control weighting of soft segmentation:

|  |   |
| ------ | ------ |
| w_fidelity_lsl2 | weight of L2-norm least-squares data fidelity term |
| w_ridge | weight of ridge (Tikhonov) regularization (prevents over-fitting)|
| w_tvl2 | weight of L2-norm total variation regularization (smoothing term)|
| threshold_opacity| clips opacity values below the threshold to 0 before saving (set 100 for synthetic stack and 50-75 for real stack) |

The following parameters are used to control degree of flattening and contrast enhancement:

|  |   |
| ------ | ------ |
| level_contrast_enhancement | within {1, 10}, choose -1 not to enhance contrast (set -1 for synthetic stack)|
| level_flattening | choose > 1, you may get assertation error if too high, just decrease it (especially images with high frequency components)|
| iterations_flattening | flatten several times (e.g., 2-4) |

Soft segments (opacity layers) will be saved as tiff files, you may want to use ImageJ to easily load and see the results. Below, example processing results of our fast piecewise image recovery:
